Scenarios
=========

1. Valid address -> show pin on map
2. Valid address with corrections -> show pin on map, suggestion corrections
3. Partially invalid address (some elements valid, but not a street_address or sub premise) -> show greyed map, no pin, suggest user double-checks
4. Completely invalid address (zero results) -> no map, no pin, suggest user double checks
